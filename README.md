Here’s a basic README file for your digit recognition program:


# Digit Recognition using Decision Tree Classifier

This project demonstrates the use of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for recognizing digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained using pixel values from 28x28 images of handwritten digits, and the goal is to predict the digit for new images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Description of the Code

### 1. **Data Loading**:
The script loads the dataset from `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `sample_submission.csv` files using `pandas.read_csv`. These files contain the images of handwritten digits and their respective labels.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**:
- The features (pixel values) are extracted from the dataset (`X`).
- The target variable (`Y`) is the label representing the digit for each image.

### 3. **Train-Test Split**:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. 80% of the data is used for training, and 20% is used for testing the model.

### 4. **Model Training**:
A **Decision Tree Classifier** is used to train the model with the training data (`X_train`, `Y_train`).

### 5. **Model Testing**:
- The model predicts the label of a test image (`X_test[100]`).
- The predicted label is compared to the actual label, and the image is displayed using `matplotlib`.

### 6. **Visualizing the Results**:
The 100th test image is displayed as a 28x28 grid to visualize the handwritten digit. The prediction is printed along with the actual label.

## Running the Code

To run the program, simply execute the script:

```bash
python digit_recognition.py
```

This will train the model on the training data and test it on the test data. The program will display the test image and output the predicted digit.

## Example Output

```bash
Accuracy: 0.85
Predicted label for the 100th test image: 5
```
